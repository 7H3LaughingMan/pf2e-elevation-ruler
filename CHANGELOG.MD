# v12.327.2

- Limit actions in combat
    - If a token is Immobilized, Paralyzed, Petrified, or Unconcious they get 0 actions.
    - If a token is a minion then it's base number of actions is 2.
    - If a token is quickened it raises the base number of actions by 1.
    - If a token is Slowed or Stunned it will reduce the number of actions based on the value.
        - This is compatible with PF2e Workbench's auto reduction of the stunned condition.
    - There is a setting to disable the reduction of actions if a token is Slowed/Stunned.
